# DeepLearning Cookie Detector

## Problem Statement: 

Design, develop and test a Deep Learning Network to classify good crackers versus broken crackers based on transfer learning with the Alexnet network. 

For this lab I took 32 pictures of good cookies and 24 pictures of bad cookies for my network. The first step was to train the network. After the pictures were taken and separated I made the network. I spent a lot of time modifying the options to streamline and refine the network.

From there I set up my camera and set up my environment variables for the test. This included mounting the camera so that my hands were free and minimizing lighting from screens and other rooms.

As you can see it did fairly well when detecting bad cookies and an excellent job detecting good cookies.I would like to add more images and refine my external variables in the future.

## Conclusion: 

Overall the final product was accurate in detecting if a cookie was bad or good. The most difficult part was modifying the options so that the trained network was refined and accurate. I spent several hours refining this and the environment. After all things were set and optimized the network performed well. I think if I were to redo this project I would take an equal amount of pictures for both the good cookies and the bad cookies. Very cool project and I know why you pushed it so much. The applications that can be used with this training are almost unbounded. A more stable environment and better instrumentation would do a lot of justice.
